History of Online shopping in Bangladesh : Everyone know\\n                online shopping is many popular in a country like USA,UK or any other\\n                European country. And they start their e-commerce journey many before.\\n                But it’s should be a question to your minds or many others, How and when\\n                e-commerce or online shopping comes in Bangladesh ? Which is the first\\n                e-commerce company in Bangladesh ? are they still alive or not? OK! I am\\n                breaking your curiosity.\\n              \")]),e._v(\" \"),o(\"p\",{staticStyle:{\"text-align\":\"justify\",\"line-height\":\"28px\",padding:\"5px\",\"font-size\":\"16px\",\"margin-top\":\"20px\"}},[e._v(\"\\n                Let’s go to the flashback, It was 1999 when the first e-commerce company\\n                comes in Bangladesh And Munshiji.com is the first e-commerce company in\\n                bangladesh. that was not too much easy to start online shopping business\\n                in bangladesh . It was not welcomed in Bangladesh at the beginning\\n                stage. And Due to politics, slow internet, and poverty of our country\\n                and others so many problems they stop their business in bd. After that\\n                many companies have tried so many times but could not see the bright\\n                sun. Though many people don’t know about Munshiji.com but they know\\n                about ekhanei.com is first online shop in bangladesh. So,let’s discuss\\n                when bangladeshi people started to know about online shopping . It was\\n                2006 when ekhanei.com officially published by grameenphone and at the\\n                same time they open cellbazar. And for the first time, It was a\\n                successful project. And it’s open the eye of the investor. And many\\n                investors inspire from them. And If we go to the flashback then we find\\n                that It was the turning point to open the eye of investor and highly\\n                inspire others to come in this sector. And after that Here comes Bikroy\\n                and totally change the mind setup and widely give a good sound to people\\n                to engage with the online marketplace. Though online shopping in\\n                Bangladesh was not popular and not welcomed at the beginning stage it’s\\n                come with many upwards and downwards in bd. And took about one and a\\n                half decades to get success to come to today’s stage. And now many\\n                companies like ajkerdeal,daraj and gearboost are come to the stage and\\n                make easier shopping for people. 2. 10 reason for online shopping in\\n                bangladesh Though there are so many reason to do online shopping in\\n                bangladesh.But I will show you most 10 important reason that attract you\\n                to do online shopping at bangladesh. So,let’s start : 1. Unbearable\\n                Traffic Jam : If you live in Dhaka city then you will agree with me\\n                that, the traffic jam of Dhaka city is totally out of control from you.\\n                Because the road of Dhaka city is limited and many times VIP person go\\n                on the road. And then start non-stop traffic. If your time is so much\\n                important and you want to save your valuable time and not want the\\n                hassle of traffic jam then online shopping is the best alternative\\n                solution for you. 2. Get rid of product price bargains : If you have\\n                experience of shopping in Dhaka city or anywhere of Bangladesh then you\\n                will appreciate with me that, If you want to buy products from shopping\\n                mall and not want to be foolish then you must bargain about product\\n                price with the shopkeeper. Because, If you visit then you see the\\n                majority of shopping mall in Bangladesh, the product price is not fixed.\\n                And If you are a new customer then the shopkeeper will try to make you\\n                foolish. And want to take two multiple prices to you from the real\\n                price. So, If you buy products from online then you don’t need to\\n                bargains with the shopkeeper.because the price of online products are\\n                fixed. 3. Get rid of shopkeeper Bad behaviour : Though maximum\\n                shopkeeper behavior is good. But there are some shopkeeper who will show\\n                a bad attitude to you if you pricing the product but not buy from him\\n                with any reason. An example, at new market in Dhaka there is a market\\n                called Chandrima super market. Here a lady was hassled with language by\\n                the shopkeeper. And then the police arrest the shopkeeper. And that news\\n                came in many newspapers at that time. You may check.\\n              \")]),e._v(\" \"),o(\"p\",{staticStyle:{\"text-align\":\"justify\",\"line-height\":\"28px\",padding:\"5px\",\"font-size\":\"16px\",\"margin-top\":\"30px\"}},[e._v(\"\\n                So, If you do your shopping online then you have not any risk or tension\\n                about this matter.because in online shopping system you will not connect\\n                with shopkeeper directly. And if you have any complaint about the\\n                products or shopkeeper then you can do it with your website helpline\\n                where you buy the products. And then they will take action on the\\n                shopkeeper. 4. Product refund : If you buy a product from any physical\\n                shopping mall and then if any product has any problem but the shopkeeper\\n                hide it to you and you found that after come into your house then what\\n                will you do? Obviously, you must go back to shopkeeper.but most of the\\n                cases if the shopkeeper is not an honest person, he will not refund your\\n                product anymore. And will say you, why not you see that before buying.\\n                And they not refund product after buy. Though there have some shop who\\n                have 7 or 10 or 15days refund policy. but the majority have not yet. On\\n                the other hand, if you buy products from online and find the problem of\\n                products or the products is not the same as you saw then you will get\\n                chances to refund it with 3days. And almost every online shopping\\n                company have the refund policy. 5. Varieties of price waste your Time :\\n                Suppose you want to buy a shirt or dress and one shopkeeper tell you the\\n                price is $15 and other says it $10. But the shirt color is the same but\\n                you think the Cloth Threads are different. Or you buy a shirt or dress\\n                and visit too many shops and getting confused about what should buy or\\n                what not! And it’s really wastage of many people including me also in\\n                the psychical shop. So, If you won't get rid of confusion and save your\\n                time then online shopping in Bangladesh is the best option for you.\\n                6.All of your products in one shop : Do you want to buy a t-shirt, a\\n                watch, a cricket bat and also a frying pan?If yes, and from psychical\\n                shopping mall then you must go to four shops. And you find one is market\\n                ‘A’ and other is marke ‘B’ and others are market ‘C’ then what will you\\n                do? You must go everywhere if you want to buy. But in the online\\n                shopping at Bangladesh you don’t need to go to many shops.You will get\\n                all of your products in one place, just add to cart your every product\\n                and buy it in one click. And it will save you many times and make simple\\n                to your life 7.The risk of political strike : Suppose you are ready for\\n                your shopping and comes in the road from your house and see that today\\n                is one kind of strike and the busses are stopped for this. And you can’t\\n                go there or go to the market with extra bus fare and risk. And also it\\n                wastes your many valuable time. On the other hand, if you buy your\\n                products from online shopping of Bangladesh then you don’t take any\\n                headache about this. 8.Is market close or Open : If you live in the\\n                Dhaka city or anywhere in Bangladesh then you know that every market has\\n                a specific different holiday.\\n              \")]),e._v(\" \"),o(\"p\",{staticStyle:{\"text-align\":\"justify\",\"line-height\":\"28px\",padding:\"5px\",\"font-size\":\"16px\",\"margin-top\":\"30px\"}},[e._v(\"\\n                An example Eastern Plaza, Bashundhara City, New Market are closed on\\n                Tuesday but mirpur 1 market closed in Thursday and Mirpur 10 or IDB of\\n                agargaon are closed in Sunday. So, If you target one market and go on\\n                there on the closed days and you will get back with Bare hands and waste\\n                your money and time. Besides, The online shopping of Bangladesh Are open\\n                for you 24hours of a day 7days of a weak and 365days of a year. When\\n                your mind wants,what your mind want you can check the price of the\\n                product and buy it in your preferred time. So, you are welcome in the\\n                online shopping to Bangladesh. 9.Payment system and safety :If you don’t\\n                have any car. You always going shopping without your personal vehicle, I\\n                think the majority of us have not a personal car yet. Then you have a\\n                risk of loss of your money bag or handset on the bus or other vehicles\\n                in Dhaka city. And if you looked that the online shopping Bangladesh\\n                system then you will find that, if you buy a product then you can pay it\\n                from your mobile bank account or cash on delivery(that means pay after\\n                getting your product). Where you have not to go anywhere and not have\\n                any risk. You can pay with full of your safety. 10.online shopping in\\n                bangladesh with home delivery: Do you think a product you see on your\\n                monitor just order with a click and get it on your hand without any\\n                hassle?

The major problem of\\n                online shopping : I think there is no service in the world without any\\n                kinds of problem. And for the first of any service, there should be some\\n                problem. And bangladesh is not out from those rules. And there has some\\n                problem also. ? Product not delivery on right time: This is the most\\n                common complaint of customer or almost 70-80% of the customer complaint\\n                about this that the products deliver with delay 2-3 days or 7days delay\\n                from their given timing. ? Real time tracking system : In bangladesh, No\\n                e-commerce company still not start any real time tracking system where\\n                the customer could ensure where their product is now? and how it is? Is\\n                there any problem happened with my product? why so late ? all of the\\n                questions could be answered if the real time tracking system open. And I\\n                think it will open very soon . And it will be more popular. ? Wrong\\n                product delivery : Sometimes by mistake, they deliver Wrong product to\\n                the customer for their wrong packing and then customer get angry on them\\n                and refund the products. And if the customer needs the product then he\\n                again re-order to deliver the product. And It’s waste and gives a hassle\\n                to the customer. ? Wrong address or information:Either some bad customer\\n                to take an act of revenge or want to give some hassle to the delivery\\n                man they don’t pick up their phone on product delivery time or when the\\n                delivery man would go his house or neither given a wrong address to\\n                delivery address. And for some that reason, the online shop got some\\n                strict and not want to deliver with only a product. They deliver product\\n                in one area with many customers.so that, if one or two customers given\\n                wrong information but the maximum product will deliver on the right time\\n                . And if we want to understand that , It’s also a reason for late\\n                delivery of our product. 6.The safety of online shopping : It’s can be a\\n                question to your mind . Am I safe with online shopping ? Is my data\\n                secure ? or my online payment or bkash/rocket in a risk ?

Yes now, I\\n                tell you how can safe with that just simply follow only 1 rule. And that\\n                is , when buying any online shop then just check that their website have\\n                https:// version or not.\\n              \")]),e._v(\" \"),o(\"p\",{staticStyle:{\"text-align\":\"justify\",\"line-height\":\"28px\",padding:\"5px\",\"font-size\":\"16px\",\"margin-top\":\"30px\"}},[e._v(\"\\n                If it’s on https:// or there have a locked button on there. Or if it\\n                without https version that means you do not properly save with your\\n                data. It can be a risk for you. So, I highly recommend you not to buy\\n                anything without SSL or https:// version site.
