### Bug fixes

* [`config.initialData`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_core_editor_editorconfig-EditorConfig.html#member-initialData) should be used to set the initial state of the editor instead of unsafe `innerHTML`. Closes [#51](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/51). ([950b49a](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/950b49a))

### Bug fixes

* Improved performance when editing large content. Debounced the component `#input` event. Closes [#42](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/issues/42). ([dfaee36](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue/commit/dfaee36))
* The data initialization should not break collaboration. Instead of using `editor.setData()`, the initial content is now set via `innerHTML` of the source element.
